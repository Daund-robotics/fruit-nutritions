# Fruit Detection and Ripeness Workflow

This project is designed to detect fruits using AI (YOLOv8) and identify their condition (Ripe, Underripe, Overripe). 

## 1. Project Overview
The system uses YOLOv8 for detecting common fruits. If a fruit is not in the default AI model, or if you want to teach it specific ripeness conditions, you can use the "Add Data" tool.

## 2. File Structure
- `main_data_creation.py`: The main control center for adding new fruits and testing recognition.
- `main.py`: A simplified version for just recognizing fruits (no data adding option).
- `utils.py`: Contains the "brain" - AI detection logic and color analysis for ripeness.
- `database.json`: A simple file that remembers the fruits you've added manually.
- `data/`: Folder where captured images are stored.

## 3. How to use (Workflow)

### Step A: Adding New Data (Training)
1. Run `main_data_creation.py` and select **Add Data**.
2. Point your camera at a fruit. You will see a blue box tracking it.
3. Enter the **Fruit Name** (e.g., Mango) and **Condition** (e.g., Ripe).
4. Click **Capture** to take several pictures.
5. Click **Save** to store this info. **Note**: Training will now start **instantly and automatically** as soon as you hit save!
6. **Automatic Training**: The system will fine-tune the AI specifically for your fruits. Once finished, it will save as `best.pt`.

### Step B: Recognition
1. In `main_data_creation.py` (Recognize mode) or `main.py`:
2. The camera will show the fruit.
3. The AI will first check if it "knows" this fruit from its default model.
4. If you've manually trained it, it will show the name and condition from your database.
5. It identifies ripeness based on the color and patterns it sees.

## 4. Simple Explanation of Ripeness Identification
- **Ripe**: Perfect color (e.g., bright yellow for bananas).
- **Underripe**: Usually green or hard.
- **Overripe/Not Eatable**: Brown spots, dark colors, or bruised appearance.
